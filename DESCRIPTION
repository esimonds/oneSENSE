Description: A graphical user interface that facilitates the dimensional 
    reduction method based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
    (t-SNE) algorithm, for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data. With 
    One-SENSE, measured parameters are grouped into predefined categories, 
    and cells are projected onto a space composed of one dimension for each 
    category. Each dimension is informative and can be annotated through the 
    use of heatplots aligned in parallel to each axis, allowing for 
    simultaneous visualization of two catergories across a two-dimensional
    plot. The cellular occupancy of the resulting plots alllows for direct 
    assessment of the relationships between the categories.
